# Mathias Bosman - CV
![CI](https://github.com/mathiasbosman/cv/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

A simple website with a bit of Github automatisation magic containing my personal resume
on [mathiasbosman.be](http://mathiasbosman.be).


## Publishing
The application is published to Google Cloud Platform via the maven command when a new release is published on GitHub.
See [the GitHub workflow][publish_workflow].
